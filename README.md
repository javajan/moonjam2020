# moonjam2020
Randomly generated dungeon crawler with horror theme

# How to play
Host it yourself on a web server or play at: https://javajan.github.io/moonjam/index.html
You have to host it, otherwise Chrome/Firefox/... will not be able to access the assets, if you just open the .html file.

# About the game
The map is randomly generated and you have to find the key to the boss room, while not dying to simpler mobs in the process. There are 3 bosses which you can defeat, after that the game will continue and the bosses will repeat.

# Controls
WASD to move,
Left click to shoot,
E to open/close doors,
P to reset current level in case something breaks (which will never happen Kapp),
Space to sprint

# Notice
Please use Chrome as the performance is way better than in Firefox (at least in my testings: >120 vs. 60 FPS).
